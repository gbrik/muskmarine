## Disclaimer

[Elon Musk's Ipod Submarine](http://tinstargames.weebly.com/micro-games.html) is a micro game designed by Steve Dee of [Tin Star Games](http://tinstargames.weebly.com). This is an unofficial project by a developer unaffiliated with Tin Star Games.

The code for this project is still mostly that of [this Spyfall app](https://github.com/mpcovcd/spyfall
).
